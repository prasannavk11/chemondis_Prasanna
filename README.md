# Getting Started with Chemondis App

The app has two folders

api - node server for API end points

client - React app

## Please note

.env file should not be comitted but for reference I have comitted

Since docker is not working in my machine I was not able to test it.


## Available Scripts

I have used npm workspaces, so we can run the api and client parallely.
In the root directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
